Hey wanted to send over a quick message, just saw your company on google.

I run paid ads for roofing contractors.

There are no upfront costs and none of that pay-per-lead garbage either.

Just real roofing jobs and we take 5% of revenue after you sign contracts with our leads.

Let me know if there's a good time to talk about this?


Respectfully,
Mason D.G.
